Hey Guys. This is my university project build in 2013 to help university students of Mumbai to browse through the course curriculum for free. 

These seem very obvious and naive today, but back then we had no means in India/Mumbai to look at these concepts, which we are tested for in the exams. Students had to rely and depend on their college, which would also have these details only in hard copy, available on a request basis for a fee.

The project aimed to democratise fundamental knowledge and ensure that all students have access to it.

This written in HTML/JS using Adobe Phone Gap, HTML templates, and PDF files for documents. Was deployed on Google Cloud Engine

That was a mediocre attempt then, not proud of it technically. It needs a refresh and is open to people looking to upgrade it to current code platform, libraries, and frameworks.
